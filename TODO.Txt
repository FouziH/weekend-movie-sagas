*********************Weekend Project TO DO List Movies**************************
PHASE 1:
    [x] Create a database named `saga_movies_weekend`
    [x] Run the queries from `database.sql` on the `saga_movies_weekend` database
PHASE 2:
  [x] Create a detail component
        [x] Create Details.js file 
    [] When a movie poster is clicked
        [] a user should be brought to the `/details` view for that movie.
        []  it should show all the details **including ALL genres** for the selected movie.
            [] You will need to store this data in redux!
                > Hint : You can make a GET request for a specific movie. Remember `req.params` and `:id`?
        [] TODO: The details page should have a `Back to List` button, which should bring the user to the Home/List Page
