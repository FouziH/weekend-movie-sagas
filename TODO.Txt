*********************Weekend Project TO DO List Movies**************************
PHASE 1:
    [x] Create a database named `saga_movies_weekend`
    [x] Run the queries from `database.sql` on the `saga_movies_weekend` database
PHASE 2:
  [x] Create a detail component
        [x] Create Details.js file 
    [x] When a movie poster is clicked
        [x] a user should be brought to the `/details` view for that movie.
        [x]  it should show all the details **including ALL genres** for the selected movie.
            [x] You will need to store this data in redux!
                > Hint : You can make a GET request for a specific movie. Remember `req.params` and `:id`?
        [x] TODO: The details page should have a `Back to List` button, which should bring the user to the Home/List Page
### Add Movie Page

This should show:
    [x] an input field (for the movie title)
    [x] an input field (for the movie poster image URL))
    [x] a textarea (for the movie description)
    [x] a dropdown (for the genres)

The Add Movie page should have the buttons:

   [x] `Cancel` button, which should bring the user to the Home/List Page
   [x]`Save` button, which should save these inputs in the database and bring the user to the Home/List Page (which now has the new movie)

**Base functionality does not require being able to select more than one genre for a new movie**

> Hint: Look at the /api/movie POST route -- it's been made already but is performing 2 queries: one to store the movie information and another to store the genre in the junction table.

> Hint: You'll want to use the genres that are in the db for your dropdown
